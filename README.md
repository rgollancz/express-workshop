# Express Workshop

## What is this?

This is an introductory workshop to Node.js and Express. You'll be building your own platform to write, publish and save blog posts (a basic content management system, or CMS).

## Why?

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used frameworks for Node.js. It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to build your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation for becoming a Node.js developer :sparkles:

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. At the end of each segment, you should find a link to continue onto the next step. We suggest you follow along with the tutorial online, and write your code in a separate repository.

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn much more if you get into the habit of typing things out. If you want to test out small bits of code before adding them to your project, [repl.it](repl.it) is a useful tool.

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar with. These terms are explained in the [Keywords](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#keywords) section at the bottom of each page. You'll also find a link to our cheatsheets under [Useful Links](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#useful-links).
